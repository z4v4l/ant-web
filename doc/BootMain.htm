<h4>About this section</h4>
<p>
The section is dedicated to the system beginning. In it, we mention a little how
the work on it started and also, system startup is described here.
The latter is split in 2 phases <i>booting</i> and <i>initialization</i>.
Booting is a phase, that starts in the firmware environment and where
an OS delegate, the loader, is running as a client and where it is doing its
job of system booting, using services, provided by the firmware. It reads
main kernel components into RAM &mdash; <i>loading</i>, sets them up,
prepares the kernel environment and, finally, transfers control over to it.
This is OS <i>booting</i>, not just loading kernel files into RAM.

The second phase, initialization, happens in the kernel environment.
In it, kernel deploys its operating components, initializes itself, that is.
Also, it loads the rest of components from persistent storage (e.g. non-boot drivers),
initializes them and finally starts its user mode components (e.g. session manager).
After this, the OS is ready for serving users.
<p>
<p>
In the "loader overview" chapter, a brief history of the loader is described, the first steps
of the project basically, at least programming wise. Also, a short overview of the Ant booting
is given. This is illustrated with screenshots, photos and video demonstrations.
In the "booting details", there will be more details about the process.
In the "initialization overview", also, the history and the process of it are described
shortly, whereas in the "initialization details" a more technical and detalized talk goes.
