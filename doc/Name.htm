Since the naming of a barely existing project is interesting rather to only the author,
I will touch this topic quite shortly.
</p>
<h4>Kernel</h4>
<p>
The OS kernel is called <i>ANT</i>.
It references several things, &mdash; among others, of course, Windows NT,
as the ultimate source of technical inspiration. Also, my mom's name starts with these letters,
her name is Antonina. Also, "Ant" could be treated as "Amateur NT" or "Another NT".
Finally, there was a medieval Old Ukrainian tribe &mdash; Antes (Old Greek Áνται, anti),
on whose land, the Kyiv city, the capital of Ukraine was founded near the same time
(~V century AD). And I am Ukrainian. So, as you can see, I've put a lot of meanings in the
name. If I were this determined to working on the OS, it would be way more developed at this moment.
</p>

<h4>Entire OS name</h4>
<p>
Name for the entire OS is not decided yet. So, <i>Ant</i> can become the whole OS name as well.
Only the kernel name "Ant" is 100% decided so far.
</p>

<h4>Logotypes</h4>
<!-- Eye of Horus utf8 encoding &#xF0938280; -->
<p>
As for the logotype for Ant, it's basically not decided yet too. I like,
<a class="undecorated" href="res/eye.svg">the Eye of Horus symbol</a>, its picture,
boldly taken from the Internet, is shown on the main page also. So far, exactly this
symbol is being used as the logo, so, jokingly, it could be referenced as <i>eyeOS</i>.
</p>

<h4>Other names</h4>
<p>
The loader is pretty often called <i>Torpedo</i> and that is because it
has been started as a plain uboot payload. The latter doesn't provide
absolutely any functionality, interface to its payloads and I hated that (who
wouldn't), so I called the loader Torpedo, because "uboot" in German means
"submarine". That "submarine" was so pissing off, that one could only think
about one word, when thinking about it. After they decided to stop acting
haughtily towards UEFI and realized, it's their way to remain in the game,
a normal interface to payloads appeared. Completeness
and compliance remained to be a desired feature since then. But those, in
charge of UEFI supporting there, make great job, kudos for them.
</p>

<p>
As for the planned ESSs names. The main ESS name is not decided yet,
so for now, it's going to be formal <i>AntAPI</i>. Maybe I should call
it <i>Mess</i>? That would stand for <i>Main Environment SubSystem</i>.
I am tempted to call the POSIX ESS <i>PussyX</i>,
It stands for <i>Ported Unix SubSystem X</i>. And what did you think about?
</p>

<p>
Well, that's pretty much it about naming so far.
